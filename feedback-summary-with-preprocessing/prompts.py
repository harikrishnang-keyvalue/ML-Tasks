                * For example, if the student made 3 Calculation errors, 2 Conceptual errors, and 1 Measurement error, the output should be:
                    "assignment_errors": [
                        {{ "error_type": "Calculation", "value": 3 }},
                        {{ "error_type": "Conceptual", "value": 2 }},
                        {{ "error_type": "Measurement", "value": 1 }},
                        {{ "error_type": "Explanation", "value": 0 }}
                    ]
                * Do not include more than 3 weaknesses and strengths in the response.
                * List strong and weak skills only if relevant data is provided in the input. Otherwise, return an empty string.
